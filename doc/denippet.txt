INTRODUCTION					*denippet-introduction*

Denippet is a Vim/Neovim snippet plugin extended from VSCode's snippets. With
the adoption of the denops ecosystem, it has overcome the weaknesses found in
existing snippet plugins, such as those related to JavaScript regular
expressions. Additionally, it allows the use of TypeScript functions, which
means you can easily create snippets using powerful assets like date
libraries.

Requirements
	- denops.vim: https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim


==============================================================================
MAPPINGS					*denippet-mappings*

<Plug>(denippet-expand)				*<Plug>(denippet-expand)*
	Defined in insert mode (|imap|).

	Expand the snippet when the string before the cursor matches the
	trigger.


<Plug>(denippet-jump-next)			*<Plug>(denippet-jump-next)*
<Plug>(denippet-jump-prev)			*<Plug>(denippet-jump-prev)*
	Defined in insert and select mode (|imap|, |smap|).

	Go to the next or previous tabstop.


<Plug>(denippet-expand-or-jump)			*<Plug>(denippet-expand-or-jump)*
	Defined in insert mode (|imap|).

	If it can be expanded, it will be expanded. If not, and if it is
	possible to jump to the next tabstop, jump.


<Plug>(denippet-choice-next)			*<Plug>(denippet-choice-next)*
<Plug>(denippet-choice-prev)			*<Plug>(denippet-choice-prev)*
	Defined in insert mode (|imap|).

	Choose the next or previous choice in the choice node.


==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS					*denippet-functions*

denippet#load({filepath} [, {filetype}...])		*denippet#load()*
	Load the snippet definition file.

	Multiple filetypes can be specified.
	If {filetype} is omitted, it is the {filename} removed the extension.

	Using * for {filetype}, a global snippet can be defined. This is a
	snippet available for all 'filetype'.


denippet#expandable()					*denippet#expandable()*
	Return |v:true| if expansion is possible, |v:false| otherwise.


denippet#expand()					*denippet#expand()*
	Same as |<Plug>(denippet-expand)|.


denippet#jumpable([{dir}])				*denippet#jumpable()*
	{dir} where 1 means "next" and -1 means "previous".
	Return |v:true| if jump is possible, |v:false| otherwise.


denippet#jump([{dir}])					*denippet#jump()*
	{dir} where 1 means "next" and -1 means "previous".
	Same as |<Plug>(denippet-jump-next)| and |<Plug>(denippet-jump-prev)|.


denippet#choosable([{dir}])				*denippet#choosable()*
	{dir} where 1 means "next" and -1 means "previous".
	Return |v:true| if choice is possible, |v:false| otherwise.


denippet#choice([{dir}])				*denippet#choice()*
	{dir} where 1 means "next" and -1 means "previous".
	Same as |<Plug>(denippet-choice-next)| and |<Plug>(denippet-choice-prev)|.

g:denippet_sync_delay ~
	Specify delay time to sync same tabstop placeholder.

	-1: No sync (update only on |denippet#jump()| or |InsertLeave|)
	 0: Always sync
	 N: Debounce N milliseconds (N > 0)

	Default: 0

						*g:denippet_drop_on_zero*
g:denippet_drop_on_zero ~
	Whether to drop when jumping to a node with a tabstop of 0.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET GRAMMAR					*denippet-snippet-grammar*

Snippets in denippet are basically written in VSCode-compatible grammar.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets

json/toml/yaml/typescript are available for snippet definition files. To
register snippets, use |denippet#load()|. The structure of the file is as
follows: >json
	{
	  "For Loop": {
	    "prefix": ["for", "for-const"],
	    "body": [
	      "for (const ${2:element} of ${1:array}) {",
	      "\t$0",
	      "}"
	    ],
	    "description": "A for loop."
	  }
	}
<
NOTE: For compatibility with VSCode, files with the code-snippets extension
can also be read, and the scope field is respected.

Fields ~
	"prefix"	(string|string[])
		The trigger that expands the snippet. If ommited, the name
		(the key of the object, in the example "For Loop") is used
		instead. Multiple prefixes can be set for a single snippet by
		making it an array.
	"prefix_regexp"		(string|string[])
		The trigger that are JS regular expression. In TypeScript, you
		can use the match result in "body". Since "prefix" are used to
		narrow down the search in completion, please also set the
		appropriate one when using "prefix_regexp".
	"body"		(string|string[])	required!
		The text that is actually expanded. The \t (tab character) at
		the beginning of a line in "body" is corrected to the
		appropriate indentation. When body is an array, the meaning is
		different from prefix; each element means a line. In other
		words, it is equivalent to a string in which each element of
		the array is concatenated with a newline.
	"description"	(string)
		the description of the snippet, but this plugin by itself does
		not have the ability to display this. If you want to see it,
		combine it with the completion plugin.
	"if"		("base"|"start"|"vimscript"|"lua")
		You can specify the conditions under which the snippet is
		expanded.
		"base"		Available only when the current buffer is
				empty.
		"start"		Available only at the beginning of the line.
		"vimscript"	Available only if |eval()| is used to evaluate
				the string specified in "eval" and the return
				value is truthy. >toml
		[foo]
		prefix = "foo"
		body = "bar"
		if = "vimscript"
		eval = "line('.') == 1"
<
		"lua"		Available only if |loadstring()| is used to
				evaluate the string specified in "eval" and
				the return value is truthy. >toml
		[foo]
		prefix = "foo"
		body = "bar"
		if = "lua"
		eval = """
		local function foo()
		  return true
		end
		return foo()
		"""
<
	"eval"		(string)
		String evaluated when "if" is "vimscript" or "lua".


Note in TypeScript that the file structures of json/toml/yaml are different.
You need to export an object named "snippets". While its structure is
essentially the same the above, it differs in that you can use function in
"body" and "if". See type `TSSnippet` for details. >typescript
	import { TSSnippet } from "https://deno.land/x/denippet_vim@v0.5.1/loader.ts";

	export const snippets: Record<string, TSSnippet> = {
	  uuid: {
	    prefix: "uuid",
	    body: () => crypto.randomUUID(),
	  },
	};


You can use tabstops in the snippet. You can navigate between the tabstops
with |denippet#jump()|. For defailed syntax, please refer to the link.
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax

To explain briefly, it goes as follows:

Tabstops ~
	With tabstops, you can make the editor cursor move inside a snippet.
	Use `$1`, `$2` to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in
	which tabstops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the final cursor
	position. Since multi-cursors cannot be implemented in Vim, multiple
	tab stops with the same number are represented by editing one primary
	location, and its copies are updated in real-time to reflect the
	changes.

Placeholders ~
	Placeholders are tabstops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder
	text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed.
	Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

	By omitting the default value following the colon (e.g., `${1}`), it
	becomes equivalent to the above-mentioned tabstops. This is
	convenient when a number follows a tabstop. >
		foo${1}100
<
Choice ~
	Placeholders can have choices as values. The syntax is a
	comma-separated enumeration of values, enclosed with the
	pipe-character, for example `${1|one,two,three|}`. You can select the
	choice by |denippet#choice()|.

While these three are the jumpable ones, there are other syntaxes that hold
special meanings.

Variables ~
	With `$name` or `${name:default}`, you can insert the value of a
	variable. When a variable isn't set, its default or the empty string
	is inserted.

	A list of variables is here.
	https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables

	The original variables are as follows:
	- VIM		Eval default string as Vim script. >
	${VIM:['foo', 'bar'][0]}
	// -> foo
<
	- LUA		Eval default string as Lua. >
	${LUA:math.floor(1.234)}
	// -> 1
<

Transformer ~

Variable-Transform ~
	Transformations allow you to modify the value of a variable before it
	is inserted. The definition of a transformation consists of three
	parts:

	1. A regular expression that is matched against the value of a
	   variable, or the empty string when the variable cannot be resolved.
	2. A "format string" that allows to reference matching groups from the
	   regular expression. The format string allows for conditional
	   inserts and simple modifications.
	3. Options that are passed to the regular expression.

	The following example inserts the name of the current file without its
	ending, so from foo.txt it makes foo. >
	${TM_FILENAME/(.*)\\..+$/$1/}
	  |           |         |  |
	  |           |         |  |-> no options
	  |           |         |
	  |           |         |-> references the contents of the first
	  |           |             capture group
	  |           |
	  |           |-> regex to capture everything before
	  |               the final `.suffix`
	  |
	  |-> resolves to the filename
<
Placeholder-Transforms ~
	Like a Variable-Transform, a transformation of a placeholder allows
	changing the inserted text for the placeholder when moving to the next
	tab stop. The inserted text is matched with the regular expression and
	the match or matches - depending on the options are replaced with the
	specified replacement format text. Every occurrence of a placeholder
	can define its own transformation independently using the value of the
	first placeholder. The format for Placeholder-Transforms is the same
	as for Variable-Transforms.

Transform examples ~

Example					Output				Explanation
